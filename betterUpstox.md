# betterUpstox

This userscript adds simple features on https://pro.upstox.com/trading UI

* Problem: We have several positions open at one time and it gets difficult to only focus on position belonging to specific strategy.
* Solution: Create a 'watchlist', give it name of your strategy, add scripts part of the strategy in the watchlist and click on 'Filter' to only see the positions pertaining to that strategy. 
    * Once you filter, you can see number of positions in that strategy and total P&L
